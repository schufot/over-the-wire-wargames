- Background:
  - Uses `exif_imagetype()` to check if the uploaded file is an image or not
  - This PHP function reads the first few bytes of a file to determine the file type
    - Wonâ€™t be fooled by just changing the file extension
    - If the file does not begin with the header bytes that indicate it actually is an image file, it will be rejected
    - GIF start with this headers: `GIF87a`
