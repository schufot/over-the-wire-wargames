- Background:
  - HTTP is stateless:
    - No information about the session/previous requests is saved on the receivers/servers side
    - Client/browser saves session states and sends them with new requests
    - Session information is stored in cookies, allowing the otherwise stateless protocol to store and transfer stateful information
  - Cookies are sent with HTTP headers and are stored on the client side (client can manipulate them)
